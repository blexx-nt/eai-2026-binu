"""
Router Service
==============
Your job: implement two EIP patterns on top of the connection handling and
consume loop already wired up below.

1. SPLITTER: Break a multi-item order into one message per line item.
2. CONTENT-BASED ROUTER: Route each item message to a queue chosen by
   item['type'] -- physical / digital / subscription.

Consumes from: orders.incoming
Publishes to:  orders.physical, orders.digital, orders.subscription

Required shape of each item message you publish (the aggregator and the
tests depend on every one of these fields being present):

    {
        "orderId": "<same orderId as the incoming order>",
        "correlationId": "<same value as orderId -- this is what lets the
                            aggregator group results from the same order>",
        "itemIndex": <0-based position of this item within order['items']>,
        "totalItems": <len(order['items'])>,
        "item": <the original item object, unchanged>
    }

Every item message for a given order MUST carry the same correlationId and
the same totalItems -- that is how correlation is preserved once the order
has been split into independent messages travelling independent paths.
